In this paper, we attempt to examine whether the use of change-point analysis techniques is appropriate for detecting fatigue based on data captured from wearable sensors. As such, we perform a **secondary data analysis** to the data generated in: [Baghdadi et al., 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936). The reader should note that their raw data was preprocessed using:  
  (A) *Kalman Filter:* Used to process the raw data from sensors to: (i) estimate the spatial orientation of the body with respect to the global reference frame, and (ii) to estimate the kinematics of motion.  
  (B) * Segmentation:* The motion segments where then segmented using an algorithm that assumes the existence of two peaks in the translational acceleration of the gait cycle. This assumption was justified based on the results of [Tongen and Wunderlich, 2010](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mathematics-and-sports/biomechanics-of-running-and-walking/0DC334F72A56527FC4517B297923E9D3) as well as the authors' preliminary analyses.
  
The reader can **show** any code chunk by clicking on the *code* button. We chose to make the default for the code hidden since we: (a) wanted to improve the readability of this document; and (b) assumed that the readers will not be interested in reading every code chunk.

# Loading Data & Generating Features 

The snippet below documents the list of **R** libraries that were used in this research. For convenience, we used the pacman package since it allows for installing/loading the needed libraries in one step.

```{r, load_libraries, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, error=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # clear global environment
graphics.off() # close all graphics
library(pacman) # needs to be installed first
p_load(R.matlab, plotly, extrafont, grDevices, gridExtra,
       dplyr, stringr, tidyverse, utils, reshape2,
       anomalize, MVN)
```

In the snippet below, we extract the 15 ".mat" files in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fmegahed/fatigue-changepoint/tree/master/Data/Raw) (where we loaded the data to allow for the reproduction of our work). Note that these files were originally produced in [Baghdadi et al., 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936?). Then, we perform several transformation steps: (a) extracting the data for the first three columns in the matlab arrays; and (b) computing three kinematic features from the data corresponding to these columns. Due to the differences between Matlab and R, this requires two nested *for* loops. The outer loop increments over the number of subjects, while the inner loop increments based on the different number of rows of data for each subject. Please see the comments within the code chunk for more details. 

```{r load_data, cache=TRUE}
num_subjects <- seq(1, 15)
subject_heights <- c(1.71, 1.77, 1.71, 1.59, 1.69,
                     1.63, 1.60, 1.71, 1.67, 1.78,
                     1.68, 1.55, 1.83, 1.81, 1.89)

  for (j in 1:num_rows) {
    position_x[[j]] <- raw_data[["M.i.k"]][[j]]

                    stride.duration = unlist(stride_duration)
                    )
         )
  
  # Creating a Summary Data Frame
  df_name <- paste0("subject", i, "_features")
  summary_df[i, 1] <- paste0("subject", i)
  summary_df[i, 2] <- get(df_name) %>% nrow()
  summary_df[i, 3] <- get(df_name) %>% ncol()
  summary_df[i, 4] <- get(df_name)[, 1] %>% mean() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 5] <- get(df_name)[, 1] %>% sd() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 6] <- get(df_name)[, 2] %>% mean() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 7] <- get(df_name)[, 2] %>% sd() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 8] <- get(df_name)[, 3] %>% mean() %>% round(digits = 4)
  summary_df[i, 9] <- get(df_name)[, 3] %>% sd() %>% round(digits = 4)
}
# Printing the top six rows of Subject 4's data as an example
head(subject4_features) %>% round(digits = 3)

# A Summary of the features for all 15 participants
summary_df
rm(raw_data, raw_data_size, i, j, num_rows, 
   dataholder, num_subjects, subject_heights)
save.image(file = "./Data/RGenerated/FeatureGeneration.RData")
```

Based on the analysis above, there are **three observations** to be made. *First*, we scaled the stride length and height based on the subject's height. This in essence allows us to capture the steps as a percentage of the person's height. This reduces the between subject variablity in the data and is supported by the seminal work of [Oberg et al., 1993](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.473.947&rep=rep1&type=pdf). *Second*, we showed the first six rows from Subject 4 to provide the reader with some insights into the sampling frequeny (after the preprocessing done in [Baghdadi et al. 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2018.1442936)). Note that the kinematic features are computed from the sensor channels provided in their paper. *Third*, we saved the generated data into an R.data file, which can be accessed by clicking on:  [FeatureGeneration.RData](https://github.com/fmegahed/fatigue-changepoint/blob/master/Data/RGenerated/FeatureGeneration.RData). We hope that this saved data allows other researchers to reproduce and/or build on our work.

# Detecting and Removing Outliers
In this task, we examined several approaches for *outlier detection*. We hypothesize (which seems reasonable based on visualizing the data) that these outliers constitue faulty sensor readings (since they are not sustained), and thus, we remove this data prior to any further analysis. In the subsections below, we apply different outlier detection/removal algorithms and provide the corresponding visualizatios to the data. Based on the visualizations, we implement **say the name of which approach**. For our analysis, the code is presented below and followed by the visualizations.

## Plotting the Data {.tabset .tabset-fade}
First, we use a standard line plot to depict the data for each feature by person. For the sake of facilitating the visualization process, we: (a) panel the plot such that the left, center and right panels correspond to the scaled stride length, scaled stride height and step duration, respectively; and (b) we save the results of each participant (P) in a different tab.
```{r LineGraph, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', results='asis', out.width="55%"}
# We are reading the data locally (you can download the file from GitHub)
load(file = "./Data/RGenerated/FeatureGeneration.RData")
for (i in 1:15) {
  df_transformed <- melt(get(paste0("subject",i,"_features")),
                         id.vars = "time.from.start",
                         measure.vars=c("scaled.stride.len",
                                        "scaled.stride.height",
                                        "stride.duration"
                                        )
                         )
  assign(paste0("p",i),
         ggplot(data = df_transformed,
                aes(x=time.from.start,y=value,group=variable,color=variable,
                    shape=variable)) + 
           geom_line() + theme_bw() + ylim(0,2) +
           ggtitle(paste0("Participant ",i,": Pre-filtered Data")) + 
           theme(legend.position="right", axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) + facet_wrap(~variable,nrow=1)
         )
  cat('###',paste0("P", i), "{-}",'\n')
  print(get(paste0("p",i)))
  cat('\n \n')
  
  cat('<source> <p> Based on the plots above, we observed the presence of several outliers for each participant. For the <i>scaled stride length </i>, it is unlikely that the stride length exceeds 1 for any of our participants since this means that their stride is greater than their height. For example, Participant 2 has one value that is greater than 1.75. This value is infeasible and reflects an error in either the segmentation and/or the sensor signal. Similar observations can be made for <i>the scaled stride height </i>, we expect that most of the observations to be less than or equal to 0.2. For an example, P10 has an observation which is about 0.5 and 5-6 observations that are greater than 0.2. These observations should be removed. For, the step duration we expect most of the step durations to be <span style="color:red">Lora/Amir, what does the literature say?</span>. These sensor/segmentation based errors will have to be <b>removed</b>. We do not correct them since: (a) using a <i>mean imputation (or any other form of imputation)</i> will affect our changepoint modeling results; and (b) removing them will have a negligible effect on both the sample size and more importantly, the interpretation of the sensor signal (since the data points are typically within 2 seconds). To remove them, we can: (i) use a rules-based error localization approach (see <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf">de Jong and Van der Loo, 2013</a>), or (ii) statistical outlier detection approaches (see <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:AIRE.0000045502.10941.a9"> Hodge and Austin, 2004 </a>). In our analysis, we have chosen to examine the use of the statistical approaces since the former approaches often require a follow-up application of a statistical approach (i.e. they are only useful in detecting extreme errors that are decitated by a physical/mathematical rule). Based on our dataset and plots, these errors will also be captured by a statistical approach. </p> </source>')

## Implementation of Several Outlier Detection Methods

### Boxplots for Outlier Detection  {.tabset .tabset-fade}
One of the most commonly used approaches for univariate outliers are defined to be the observations that lie outside $1.5 * IQR$, where the IQR is the inter quartile range. This can be easily implemented using in base **R** using the [boxplot.stats function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.5.1/topics/boxplot.stats). Below, we first provide the output and data plots for each person.

```{r BoxOutlierDetection, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', results='asis', out.width='55%'}
# We are reading the data locally (you can download the file from GitHub)
load(file = "./Data/RGenerated/FeatureGeneration.RData")
outliers_bp <- list() # initilizing a list to store outliers per participant
for (i in 1:15) {
  df <- get(paste0("subject",i,"_features")) # Getting Data from Sec.
  # Obtaining the Outliers for each of the three variables
  out_vals_sl<- boxplot.stats(df[,2])$out
  out_rows_sl <- which(df[,2] %in% out_vals_sl)
  out_vals_sh<- boxplot.stats(df[,3])$out
  out_rows_sh <- which(df[,3] %in% out_vals_sh)
  out_vals_sd<- boxplot.stats(df[,4])$out
  out_rows_sd <- which(df[,4] %in% out_vals_sd)
  # Generating a union set of all obs. that have outliers
  # True: if any of the 3 vars for that obs. is an outlier
  outliers_total <- unique(c(out_rows_sl, out_rows_sh,
                             out_rows_sd))
  outliers_bp[[i]] <- outliers_total # saving it to list indexed by participant number
  
  # Remove the observations corresponding to the outliers
  assign(paste0("subject",i,"_bp"), 
         df[-outliers_total,])  
  
  # Preparing the data for the Line Graph
  df_transformed <- melt(get(paste0("subject",i,"_bp")),
                         id.vars = "time.from.start",
                         measure.vars=c("scaled.stride.len",
                                        "scaled.stride.height",
                                        "stride.duration"
                                        )

  cat('\n \n')
  
  cat('<source> <p> Based on the 15 charts above, one can see that using the standard boxplot approach for removing the outliers have resulted in a smoother time-series for all participants. However, the percentage of observations removed as a function of this application is high (i.e. >= 10) for partcipants 6-7, 10, 11-13 and 15. Note that for these participants, the percentage was always under 15%, with the exception of participant 11 who had 23.66% of his/her\'s observation removed as a function of this approach. <b>This obviously represents an unacceptable amount of data lost, and as such we will examine additional methods for removing/detecting outliers. </b> \n \n </p> </source>')

### Time-Series based Methods
We will need to read about the following methods:

(A) The [ecp package](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.3295.pdf), which provides some insights into a multivariate (time-series?) based method. 

(B) The [anomalize package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/anomalize/vignettes/anomalize_methods.html), which provides the following: 

  (i) Two univariate implementations based on the interquartile range and the generalized extreme studentized test. Note that their default of the IQR is different than base **R** (and that of most standard statistical textbooks). They use 3 simialr to that found in the [forecast package's](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/forecast.pdf) *tsoutlier()* function. 
  
  (ii) For time-series implementations, the [anomalize package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/anomalize/vignettes/anomalize_methods.html) presents two additional methods *stl* and *twitter (twitter decomposition)*, which are inputs to its *time_decompose()* function.
