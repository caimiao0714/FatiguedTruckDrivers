# Fatigued Truck Drivers

This folder serves to provide reproducible examples to obtain online data and build complex Bayesian statistical models on truck drivers' fatigue.

We are considering the following models to understand truck driver's fatigue patterns:

- revised form Bernoulli regression
- censored Poisson regression
- Weibull regression

Real time weather data are obtained from multi-platform and high quality weather database: DarkSky API.
